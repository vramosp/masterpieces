Halloween decorationsAs part of the pandemic activities and social distant accepted activites, we drove by lots of houses during Halloween 2020 to see the decorations. Both Mar and Layla loooooved them.

When Halloween was over, Layla kept on asking to see more Halloween decorations. She didn't understand that Halloween was over and now it was the turn of the Christmas lights. Finally, she seemed to accept the fact that we were not going to see any other spooky creatures during our drive bys and she was simply happy with the lights, the snowmen, and all of the other Christmas decorations.

A couple of days before the 25th, she asked daddy a very special request. We're still not sure if she meant to ask this to Santa or to whom but here's what she decided she really wanted for Christmas:

We're still trying to figure out what she wanted. All we know is when Christmas was over, two big things happened in her world:

> Yay! It's Halloween time again!
Nooooo, what happened to the Christmas tree? (And she went to check if we had thrown away the ornaments in the trash).
